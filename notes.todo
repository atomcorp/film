Task:
  ✔ Throttle search within Redux, so we can show loading icon when user is typing or just do it through state maybe @done (18-05-05 11:12)
  ✔ Click on film name should add it into your collection @high @done (18-05-05 11:12)
  ☐ Actions you can perform on collections include: watched (toggle), prioritise
    ✔ watched @done (18-05-05 11:46)
  ☐ Lists: Watched list, to watch list
  ☐ Filter by director etc (need another API req). Maybe get it when you add film to your collection @idea
  ☐ Add user (name), maybe stats
  ☐ Drag and drop the movie names for order (omg use: https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd)
  ☐ Use thumbs up/down when clicking Watched
